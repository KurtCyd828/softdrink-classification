# softdrink-classification
A CNN-based image classification model to identify softdrink brands using TensorFlow and Keras.

# 🥤 Softdrink Classification using CNN

A computer vision project that uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to classify images of softdrinks into different categories. Built and trained in **Google Colab** using **TensorFlow/Keras**.

---

## 📌 Features

- Image classification of multiple softdrink brands
- CNN architecture for feature extraction and prediction
- Trained on a custom image dataset
- Visual evaluation of model accuracy and predictions

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib
- ImageDataGenerator / Custom dataset

---

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Open `Softdrink_Classification.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Upload the dataset folders (`train/`, `test/`, etc.) containing softdrink images.
3. Run the notebook to:
   - Preprocess and augment images
   - Build and train the CNN model
   - Evaluate performance with accuracy/loss plots

---

## 📂 Dataset

Custom dataset of softdrink images, organized by brand folders (e.g., `/coke`, `/pepsi`, `/sprite`). May be manually collected or sourced from web scraping.

---

## 🔮 Future Work

- Add more brands for classification
- Improve accuracy with deeper models (e.g., VGG, ResNet)
- Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask
